## AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate - Preparation

ALL RIGHT Mates!!

Since April 2021 I've started to study for my SAA-C02 certification. It should have been a breeze to find quality material that would help me to learn AWS and prepare myself for the certification, right?

Well, not quite :)

I was not happy with the material available (or at least the available material I could get access to :-] )

To remediate that, I've started to read AWS documentation and get my hands even dirtied investigating AWS and DOCUMENT EVERYTHING during the process. Yeah, it will be a long journey, but I want to share everything I'm learning here and hope it may help others that are looking for thee same content.

# Please keep in mind that it is WIP and will change a lot
# Please keep in mind that I'm updating this document during my free time (mostly during late night and Sundays :)) expect very irregular updates
