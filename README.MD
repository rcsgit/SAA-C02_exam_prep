## AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate (SAA-C02) - Preparation  

**ALL RIGHT Mates!!**  

Since April 2021 I've started to study for my SAA-C02 certification. It should have been a breeze to find quality material that would help me to learn AWS and prepare myself for the certification, right?  

Well, not quite :)

I was not happy with the material available (or at least the available material I could get access to :-] )

To remediate that, I've decided to go directly to AWS DOCS for doing my readings, investigate & experiment AWS services and **DOCUMENT EVERYTHING** during the process. Yeah, it will be a long journey, but I want to share everything I'm learning here and hope it may help others that are looking for thee same content.

**Please keep in mind that it is WIP and will change a lot**
**Please keep in mind that I'm updating this document during my free time (mostly during late night and Sundays :)) expect very irregular updates**  

**Mates, your feedback is highly appreciated. Please let me know how are you enjoying this documentation and how it could be improved. Please, reach out ;)**
